# 1. Biocore Hyperdrive
I wanna touch on the big thing first, the new mode.<br>
To be honest, i really do feel like this could greatly be used as a more casual maybe even a warm-up mode for some people, though it should never be part of competitive, if you even had it associated with comp. Going further with this, i would say, more people would make this gamemode more interesting, not right now because i see that players are very limited but maybe later on you should up the playercount or teamcount for this mode.

## 1.1 Summary Hyperdrive
Not ideal for a competitive setting. Maybe up the team-/playercount and it could be used for casual/warm-up.

# 2. Dates and Communication
I still feel like there is a lack in communication to the general community about dates, specific times or rules.<br>
Its nice that there was a said ending date for the Turf War Qualifier, though nothing about the specific time of the finals or even how that will go on, same with the underdogs event. To be honest except for the "1 team per bracket qualify" info, i did not know anything about the event. Now this could be just me missing stuff, but the people i talked to did not know either, so i don't think so.<br>
It says place 5-50 are qualified to take part in underdogs tho there are only 3 clans that moved to finals. Now i know this will probably change, due to the server outage, though all of it should be set beforehand to know what the top dogs and the players are working with and for.<br>
Also to touch on the specific times real quick, starting on a Friday mid day is crazy and ending on a normal Monday at the same time is even crazier, not gonna lie. I really don't know who thought of that, but it should really be reconsidered doing these times for a event that has to do with playtime. <br>

## 2.2 Summary Communication
Lack of clear communication on event dates, times, and rules. Top Dogs had an end date but no info on finals timing or format, and Underdogs lacked clarity beyond basic qualifications. Event times (Friday midday start, Monday midday end) are inconvenient and should be reconsidered.


# 3. Balancing
In general i think PF done a good job at balancing with the little feedback they had. I'll go more in dept in the specific categories.

## 3.1 Weapons
I don't have much to say about this, though i'll touch on it really quickly.<br>
For the guns, i feel like in this beta, i have thought about everything pretty equally, obviously people will still pick up a 100 power SMG before they buy a 500 sniper. That's why they are still used more, but with the undergone changes i feel like plasmas have received the changes they need and the other guns are all very viable.<br>

### 3.1.1 Changes

#### 3.1.1.1 Heavy AR
There is one exception, Heavy assault rifles feel like shit as of now. They definitely need a buff.


#### 3.1.1.2 Beam gloves
Alright. Now, ive added this late, after having a closer chat with aidan and other people with different opinion since i thought it was pretty clear whats up with the beam gloves.

Anyway, generally i would say that the beamgloves in 2v2 is just way to strong and theres basicly no existing counterplay. Now my recommendations to counter this.

As said before one possibily is, to give the healer a increase in incoming damage while using heal. Tho i dont think this will be enough since its hard to even get on the healer.
Secondly, a better idea is that there should be nades that dissable healing, this could well be implemented by emp nades and emp event.
One more idea is that certain nades or all nades do more dmg to healer and healed.
All of these could be paired. 

I really thought this was clear for everyone that beamgloves were too good, but i guess not. In this next segment il explain my reasoning for interested

If this game continoues to go into a competitive direction, which is what i think will happen, forcing players to play a certain gun is in on its own not a good idea, paired with the fact that beam gloves are extremly lame to play for the average player it will scare a lot of people off.
The counterplay for this gun is nonexistent, i have heard mentions about "repositioning" and "force push". Now first of all almost every position can be played with beam gloves, and just rotating around for ages to get 2 kills is not fun at all nor productive for the games pace.
Yes there is certain counterability such as nades, tho if youre not playing against new players they wont really be affected by that.
Another thing is that they dont have a skill ceiling nor is theire "skillfloor" anything hard at all, so basicly anyone can use them the same good mostly.
Now for the grenades that dissable healing, i wouldnt have thought i needed to explain myself, but most players run a close range and a far range gun. so mostly far range cant be used in closerange. Beamglove people, will probably more so go for a closerange gun as theyre secondary. So if theyre heal gloves are infact dissabled, they still have the same winning chances than the other team. So the only thing they do is make a fight fair for the amount of time the grenade lasts.


### 3.1.2 Summary Weapons
In general, weapon balance feels good with viable options across the board. However, heavy assault rifles stand out as underperforming and could use a buff.

## 3.3 Perks and Abilities
Most things are staying the same from what i previously said.<br>
Now one thing i want to say is, hacker and saboteur are both good enough on their own, even tho I've said they are not before.



## 3.4 General Balancing
Make some of the utility items cheaper, i'm not talking about the shield repairs, but the heavy ammo as example, if you run a tribunal or something alike, the ammo gets to expensive really quickly and the return is just not there as previously mentioned.


# 4. Soundeffects/Animations
I'm not sure if i sent this in, i added it late to my nextfest feedback so i'l just copy paste it here.<br>
<br>
This section goes over smoothness of the game, not really finetuning in my opinion because it really helps a lot with how good the game feels or rather how finished the game feels.

## 4.1 Visual Animations
What i mean by this is inspects, reloads, physics for guns like if you land heavily your gun is impacted, etc. you know what i mean. Even though it doesn't sound really important, i feel like it makes the game more responsive and alive. This might help with new players because it makes it look less like a in development game or lets say it makes it look further in its development. <br>
I've noticed this more and more as i test different games, but for me at least it changes a lot about the feel of the game in general. If you look at something like Apex, maybe a Kraber you really feel the weight of the gun, not only in movement speed but also in animations. If you would land from a height, you'd see the character "stabilize" the gun first. I'm not saying that this should interfere with quick scopes or movement in general, just visually.

### 4.1.1 Summary Animations
Improved animations (like reloads or impact on heavy landings) could make the game feel more polished and immersive. It adds a sense of weight and responsiveness, similar to games like Apex Legends

## 4.2 Sound Effects
Same as with the Visuals, this will just make the game feel more alive and responsive, really. This will be about as an example a Sniper shot feeling like a sniper shot. Like if you shoot a heavy sniper there should be a significant and satisfying sound. Same with headshots in general and other guns obviously. As you see i like to take Apex as an example, but i feel like in this they did really good. But again look at a Kraber or shield crack sound from Apex. You just find it satisfying to use, same with other guns in apex and from other games. One more example, The headshot sound from The Cycle: Frontier, is one of the best I've heard. It's distinct but very noticeable and satisfying.

### 4.2.1 Summary Effects
Distinct, impactful sound effects for actions like sniper shots or headshots add to player expirience overall. Apex Legends and The Cycle: Frontier are great examples where sound design enhances gameplay feedback.


# 5. Conclusion
Biocore Hyperdrive works well as a casual mode but isn’t fit for competitive play, consider increasing player/team count for more fun. Communication about event dates, times, and rules is lacking and needs fixing, especially with inconvenient schedules. Balancing is decent, but heavy assault rifles need a buff, and event mechanics like Deathbringer should get nerfed. Lastly, improving sound effects and animations would make the game feel smoother and more polished.
