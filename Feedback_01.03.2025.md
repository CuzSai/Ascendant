# Changes
Generally i wanna join Aidan with saying this is the best Ascendant has felt, both Movement and Gunplay wise.

## Movement
In general the movement feels incredibly nice and clean, the more consistent slides really helped.
### Wind Vortexes
Make them a core aspect of the map meaning every wind vortex should be on and maybe more should be added. One of the best games i had this test was when most wind vortexes were on.
### Inertia
> **NOTE**
> With **slide hopping** i mean being able to continuously slide cancel right after landing.

Something i have been feeling for a long time now but couldn't really categorize.
In general the Inertia when going from still standing to running or still standing to walking is just plain annoying in my opinion. This leads to slide hopping not being available at all and generally instant movement just being annoyingly limited.

How i would solve this is removing inertia from still standing or nearly removing it. 
This would open up the movement possibilities in general.
### Slide Cancel
In Ascendant the problem with this is, that the gravity is so incredible low that you just stay in the air giving the enemy and insanely easy tracking target.

My personal solution would be to just tune up that gravity but i understand that that might not fit  the games feel in general.
That's why i suggest changing slide cancels like this:
When slide canceling decrease the jumping height drastically while turning it into carrying more momentum from your slide speed. 
So basically you're in the air less then before while carrying more momentum into the jump. 
### Pulse Generators/Jumppads
Same opinion as Aidan, to little significant usage.
## Hit Registration
While on EU (30ms) the Hit Registration has, again, felt incredibly good for what ive seen before. On NA (120ms) A fourth of the bullets i shoot just dont count, they make the hit sound but dont display dmg numbers and dont count. 
Now i know it isnt ideal to play on 120ms but i do believe it can be made more playable.
## Weapons
### Non-Customs
While i am a custom advocate, i still think the Non-Customs should atleast have some usability besides being a secondary that is picked up from the ground. 
To solve this i would suggest a general decrease in cost.
### Pistol Visual
I really like the new design of the pistol. The little spin is just generally a great addition.
What i would like to see is the spinning animation being on the inspect.
### Snipers
In my opinion snipers in general should have a way faster ADS speed. Further boosted by buffing the "Quick-Scope" Scopes.
### 1x Scopes
Here i also agree with Aidan, 1x Scopes would be a very important addition.
## Consumables Rotation
I already sent it in but it seems fitting in here so.

## Cloak Device
Please add this, the perk with it too.
## Events
### Forest
This event should be on in every match. It makes the farming a lot more enjoyable. Making it easier, faster while also bringing more diversity of power sources.
### Drills
Same as the pulse generators, its just too little outcome for the time it takes.
## Bots
I agree with the others that have already said it. Bots need to be removed, and as Aidan said it takes away from the amazing experience Ascendant brings in real 4x3.
Also what i think ice said, i would much rather wait 10min in queue to have one real match then wait 3 minutes just to have 2 bot Teams.
# Bugs
## Sniper Scope-In
When sniping in with sniper the cross hair blends in faster than the sight is put to the eye, in result it looks really bugged.
## Sliding
Duh.
