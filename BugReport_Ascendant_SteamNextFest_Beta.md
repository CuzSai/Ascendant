## Introduction
I will try to sort it as good as possible and make it easily navigatable, some of these may already be fixed or sent in.
<br>
<br>

### No damage bug
I would assume it's just hits not registering. Only happenened a few times and same match was fine in other fights <br>

### Shield repairs not working
This happened in two matches and did not get fixed after death, though after match.<br>

<br><br>
### Very far Biocore jump
Sadly didnt get it in frame better but you can definitely see that the rocket jump was only triggered at the very end<br>

### Bot inside extract vehicle while stealing Biocore

<br><br>
### Gorlizard inside tree and big bugged jump
If you jump right after activating leap, you can jump way higher and get a quicker deploy in the air. Also able to slide if ground is hit.<br>

### Gorlizard on interesting spot in Cave Outpost
Again, made possible through jumping right after activating leap.<br>

### Gorlizard unshootable while in his head
This not only happens on wild Gorlizard but also with controlled one, just didnt have a clip of it.<br>

### Horizontal movement is bugged
It got fixed after death but very weird bug.<br>
